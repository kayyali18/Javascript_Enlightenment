# Javascript Objects

My JS Enlightenment Learning Journey. Safe-keeping my education

## Objects are just containers for properties

Invoked with Object() constructor function
Majority of values in JS are objects, excepting primitive values:
`'foo', 5, true/false`
They have their own equivalent wrapper objects

See **everything_is_an_object**

## Methods

Properties that contain a function object

## Custom Constructors

We make them so we don't have to make one off objects with new Object(), instead we have a 'Class' blueprint.

This also allows us to set up prototypal inheritance for all our instances
